# YAST for German

`Yet another syntax theory` (YAST) is an experimental syntactic approach to the syntax of German, although the general approach might also be useful for other languages. 

- The approach is being described in [`yast.md`](text/yast.md).
- The implementation is written in Python using XML-tree structures, see [`yast.py`](yast.py)
- The python notebook shows some examples of how this is supposed to work [`yast.ipynb`](yast.ipynb)
- Some XML examples are in the directory [`examples`](examples).
- A (flawed) attempt to display such an XML structure is `show_example.html`. For this to work, cross-origin restrictions (CORS) have to be disabled in the browser.
